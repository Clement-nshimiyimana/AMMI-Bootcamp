Graph Convolutional Networks

This is pytorch implementation of paper :https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf which was implemented before in tensorFlow. 
The main idea of this paper is to use Graph Convolutional Networks for the task of (semi-supervised) classification of nodes in a graph.

In this work, we load data from pytorch geometric.  We used citation network data (Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed). The original datasets can be found here: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sen/lbc-proj/LBC.html. In our version (see data folder) we use dataset splits provided by https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid (Zhilin Yang, William W. Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings, ICML 2016).
